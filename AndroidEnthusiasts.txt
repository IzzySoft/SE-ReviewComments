###[Q]App recommendation
Please note that recommendations like *Is there an app for X* are off-topic here (see [What topics can I ask about here?](/help/on-topic) for details). For where your question might fit better, you might want to look into [Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?](//android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/371/16575) and [Where to ask for app recommendations?](//android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2060/16575).

###[Q]Low question quality
We will need much more information to give good recommendations here. Please [edit] your question and include at least: The device you're using, Android version it is running. Also check and update the tags you've used to match your issue.

###[Q]Development question
This site is for *users* of Android, which means that questions about development/programming are off-topic here (see the [What topics can I ask about here?](/help/on-topic)). Development questions are on-topic on our sister site [Stack Overflow](//stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android). You might also wish to consult [Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?](//android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/371/$MYUSERID$) for a fitting place to your question.

###[Q]XY-problem
This seems to be an [XY problem](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/66377/192154). Instead of trying to get your supposed solution working: Mind telling us about the issue behind it?

###[Q]More than one question asked
The question-and-answer format of this site works best if you [put each question in a separate question post](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/39223/192154). Please [edit] your post down to one question, and create new posts to ask any further questions. You'll get better answers that way.

###[Q]OP providing facts in a comment
The best way to add additional information to your question is by editing it, with the [edit] link. It is better visible that way, and comments are mainly for secondary, temporary purposes. Comments are removed under a variety of circumstances. Anything important to your question should be in the question itself.

###[Q]Frequent Question (use Search)
This happens to be a question frequently asked on our site. Have you tried our on-site search? See [How do I search?](/help/searching) for help using it.

###[Q]Crosspost
Please note that [crossposting is not welcome at SE sites](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/64068/192154), even if they would fit on multiple of them. Ask the question on the site you think is most applicable. If it does not get any answer, ask a moderator to migrate the question, or alternatively, delete it and re-ask it.

###[Q]Question includes answer
On SE sites, it's perfectly fine to [answer your own question](/help/self-answer) (also [see here](//meta.stackexchange.com/questions/17845/etiquette-for-answering-your-own-question)) – but answers should be posted as answers, not as part of the question-post. Mind [edit]ing that out of your question, and move it to a separate answer? Thanks in advance!

###[Q]List question
[List questions are no good fit for Q&A sites](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/98366/192154), and hence are [considered off-topic](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/139618/192154).

###[A]OP adding a new question as an answer
Remember this is a Q&A site, so keep on [edit]ing your question with new information – this section is for actual answers. If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](/questions/ask) button.

###[A]OP using an answer for further information
This is a question-and-answer site, [not a forum](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/92107/192154). Please use the *Post answer* button only if you have a solution to the problem, so that other users can see your question is not yet answered. You can click *edit* on the question to add more information to it.

###[A]Answers just to say Thanks!
This is a question-and-answer site, [not a forum](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/92107/192154) – so please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](/privileges) to [upvote](/help/privileges/vote-up) answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A]Nothing but a URL (and isn't spam)
Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. Otherwise, your answer becomes useless in case the link dies. For further hints, please see: [How do I write a good answer](/help/how-to-answer).

###[A]Comments as an answer (new users)

###SMS Lingo
Please don't use "txtspeak" / "SMS lingo" on SE sites, but rather fully spell each word. Many users here are no native English speakers, and some already have a hard enough time to follow normal English.

###[A]Another user adding a 'Me too!'
This is a Q&A site, [not a forum](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/92107/192154). Please use the *Post answer* button only if you have a solution to the problem.

###[A]Low quality answer
